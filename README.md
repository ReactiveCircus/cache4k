In-memory Cache for Kotlin Multiplatform.

**Work in progress.**

**cache4k** provides a simple in-memory key-value cache for **Kotlin Multiplatform**, with support for time-based (expiration) and size-based evictions.

The following targets are currently supported:

- jvm
- js
- iosX64
- iosArm64
- iosSimulatorArm64
- macosX64
- macosArm64
- tvosArm64
- tvosSimulatorArm64
- tvosX64

## Download

Dependencies are hosted on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.github.reactivecircus.cache4k/cache4k).

### Android

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.reactivecircus.cache4k:cache4k:x.y.z")
}
```

### Multiplatform

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain {
            dependencies {
                implementation("io.github.reactivecircus.cache4k:cache4k:x.y.z")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Usage

### Writing and reading cache entries

To create a new `Cache` instance using `Long` for the key and `String` for the value:

```kotlin
val cache = Cache.Builder().build<Long, String>()
```

To start writing entries to the cache:

```kotlin
cache.put(1, "dog")
cache.put(2, "cat")
```

To read a cache entry by key:

```kotlin
cache.get(1) // returns "dog"
cache.get(2) // returns "cat"
cache.get(3) // returns null
```

To overwrite an existing cache entry:

```kotlin
cache.put(1, "dog")
cache.put(1, "bird")
cache.get(1) // returns "bird"
```

### Cache loader

**Cache** provides an API for getting cached value by key and using the provided `loader: suspend () -> Value` lambda to compute and cache the value automatically if none exists.

```kotlin
runBlockingTest {
    val cache = Cache.Builder().build<Long, User>()

    val userId = 1L
    val user = cache.get(userId) {
        fetchUserById(userId) // potentially expensive call (might be a suspend function)
    }

    // value successfully computed by the loader will be cached automatically
    assertThat(user).isEqualTo(cache.get(userId))
}
```

Any exceptions thrown by the `loader` will be propagated to the caller of this function.

### Expirations and evictions

By default, **Cache** has an unlimited number of entries which never expire. But a cache can be configured to support both **time-based expirations** and **size-based evictions**.

#### Time-based expiration

Expiration time can be specified for entries in the cache.

##### Expire after access

To set the maximum time an entry can live in the cache since the last access (also known as **
time-to-idle**), where "access" means **reading the cache**, **adding a new cache entry**, or **
replacing an existing entry with a new one**:

```kotlin
val cache = Cache.Builder()
    .expireAfterAccess(24.hours)
    .build<Long, String>()
```

An entry in this cache will be removed if it has not been read or replaced **after 24 hours** since it's been written into the cache.

##### Expire after write

To set the maximum time an entry can live in the cache since the last write (also known as **
time-to-live**), where "write" means **adding a new cache entry** or **replacing an existing entry with a new one**:

```kotlin
val cache = Cache.Builder()
    .expireAfterWrite(30.minutes)
    .build<Long, String>()
```

An entry in this cache will be removed if it has not been replaced **after 30 minutes** since it's been written into the cache.

_Note that cache entries are **not** removed immediately upon expiration at exact time. Expirations are checked in each interaction with the `cache`._

### Size-based eviction

To set the maximum number of entries to be kept in the cache:

```kotlin
val cache = Cache.Builder()
    .maximumCacheSize(100)
    .build<Long, String>()
```

Once there are more than **100** entries in this cache, the **least recently used one** will be removed, where "used" means **reading the cache**, **adding a new cache entry**, or **replacing an
existing entry with a new one**.

### Getting all cache entries as a Map

To get a copy of the current cache entries as a `Map`:

```kotlin
val cache = Cache.Builder()
    .build<Long, String>()

cache.put(1, "dog")
cache.put(2, "cat")

assertThat(cache.asMap())
    .isEqualTo(mapOf(1L to "dog", 2L to "cat"))
```

_Note that calling `asMap()` has no effect on the access expiry of the cache._

### Deleting cache entries

Cache entries can also be deleted explicitly.

To delete a cache entry for a given key:

```kotlin
val cache = Cache.Builder().build<Long, String>()
cache.put(1, "dog")

cache.invalidate(1)

assertThat(cache.get(1)).isNull()
```

To delete all entries in the cache:

```kotlin
cache.invalidateAll()
```

### Unit testing cache expirations

To test logic that depends on cache expiration, pass in a `FakeTimeSource` when building a `Cache`
so you can programmatically advance the reading of the time source:

```kotlin
@Test
fun cacheEntryEvictedAfterExpiration() {
    private val fakeTimeSource = FakeTimeSource()
    val cache = Cache.Builder()
        .fakeTimeSource(fakeTimeSource)
        .expireAfterWrite(1.minutes)
        .build<Long, String>()

    cache.put(1, "dog")

    // just before expiry
    fakeTimeSource += 1.minutes - 1.nanoseconds

    assertThat(cache.get(1))
        .isEqualTo("dog")

    // now expires
    fakeTimeSource += 1.nanoseconds

    assertThat(cache.get(1))
        .isNull()
}
```

## Credits

The library was ported from a kotlin / JVM cache which I contributed to [dropbox/Store](https://github.com/dropbox/Store) to help unblock Store's multiplatform support (
it was reverted before the 1.0 release as multiplatform wasn't a priority). Many thanks to Store's owners and contributors for reviewing and improving the original implementation.
